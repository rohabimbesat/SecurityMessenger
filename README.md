# SecurityMessenger
A project made for my PolyU Security COMP3334 Assignment.
In this project, we proposed and implemented an Android-based end-to-end encryption (E2EE) messaging application that is resilient to eavesdroppersâ€™ access to read the messages between the two communicating parties or to perform a man-in-the-middle attack (MITM). The basic principle of our app is that each communicating client will be generating their own RSA key pair on their device and crucial data transmitted through the real-time database server will be encrypted by this key pair.
